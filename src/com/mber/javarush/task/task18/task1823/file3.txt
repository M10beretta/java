Today is the party! Everybody gives a present to the baby princess. The fairies also give presents. Their presents are very special. "You will be beautiful," says the first fairy. "You will be clever," says the second fairy. "You will be kind," says the third fairy. "You will sing," says the fourth fairy. "You will dance," says the fifth fairy. "You will always be happy," says the sixth fairy. Suddenly, somebody knocks on the palace door.
